FAQ<\/h2>\n\n\n\n
Please see below for answers to common questions about the space and the program.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
What is the concept of Startup Space @ Silicon Valley?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
Startup Space is being created to give early-stage ventures led by alumni or students access to a free, in-person, community-connected workspace. Groups are now being selected for the inaugural six-month cohort. The space is located within Northeastern University in San Jose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
Here in the Bay Area, there are over 7,000 Northeastern alumni\u2014from our home campus in Boston, our locally-offered graduate programs, and our global network. We’re committed to the success of our community, both students and alumni, throughout their lives. <\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
Who can apply?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
To be eligible for consideration, your startup must:<\/p>\n\n\n\n
Be an early-stage venture (with or without external funding)<\/li>
Have at least one Northeastern-affiliated founding member. <\/li>
Have a full-time commitment from the core members of your team. <\/li>
Be interested in using the space on a regular, ongoing basis.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n
You must also be willing to sign a lease for a term of six months.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
Will Northeastern offer funding to participating startups?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
No, this is not an opportunity for funding. Our staff is happy to help you navigate 
existing resources for entrepreneurs<\/a> in the Northeastern community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
If I am participating in an accelerator\/incubator, can I still apply?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
Yes, you are still welcome to apply. <\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
When will selections be made?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
Startups for the 2022-2023 cohort will be chosen before September 1, 2022. After signing a lease, selected groups will be able to move in on that date. <\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
What happens after the initial six month period?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
This is our inaugural cohort in the Startup Space. At the conclusion of six months, we will evaluate the program and decide on next steps. If the program is a success, there may be the option to renew for more time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
Where is the space located?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
The offices are located at our San Jose campus at 
4 N. 2nd Street, San Jose, CA 95113<\/a>. We are neighbors with San Jose City Hall and San Jose State University. There are many options for lunch, office services, and shipping nearby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
The building is easily accessible by Caltrain (Diridon Station and transfer to multiple bus lines), BART (Berryessa Station and transfer to Rapid 500 bus line), and most downtown San Jose bus lines. Parking is available for a daily fee at nearby lots or on the street.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
What is included in the space?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
The office space comes equipped with desks, chairs, high speed wifi, printing, reservable conference rooms, privacy “phone booths”, and furnished common areas. You will also be able to reserve the building’s patio and event space. <\/p>\n\n\n\n
Additional amenities include a game room, a gym, secure bike storage, and building security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
When can accepted teams access the space?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
Startup Space hours are the same as campus hours, which vary by season. During the academic year, the campus is open from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. on weekdays, and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekends. Please check the campus 
website<\/a> for current hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
Will there be events hosted for participating startups?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
We are excited to welcome participants into our local community, and this inaugural cohort will have a role in determining the shape of that relationship. Resident startups will at times be invited to 
on-campus or virtual Northeastern events<\/a>. Depending on interest, we may also plan events together.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
How do I apply?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
Please complete 
this form<\/a> to indicate your interest in the space. Our team will be in touch between August 15 and September 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n
\n
Can I use the space for the day without applying for the program?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n
At the moment, we are not offering drop-in workspace. Startup Space is reserved for in-house startups that have applied for a residency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
